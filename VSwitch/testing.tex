\subsection{Testing}

Note that in addition to automated tests similar to the {\tt
  public-test-router} you {\bf should} probably do integration tests
in a real network (evaluating manually with ping, wireshark, etc.).
This will help you find problems in your implementation and ensure
that your understanding of the network protocols is correct.
